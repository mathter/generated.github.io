# About
As developer we have to provide most efficiant solutions to business problems in
the shortest possible time. It is necessary to focus on the really significant aspects of business goals
and minimize the amount of mechanical work in such case. Enterprise applications became more and more
complex and more integrated each other forming entire ecosystems in our days. The testing takes
first place in developing in such case. There are large number of testing methods and great tools
such as *JUnit,TestNG* and etc. But generating of test data can be significant.

Test data generation can reach considerable effort of mechanical work which can be difficult to maintain and
boring type of activities.

# Implementation
Generated Tech Project is tool that should perform this tedious work for you. This is library for testing data
generation. Now test data generation for JVM based languages are released.

# Advantages
* Declaratively manage the creation of objects;
* Ability to reuse existing configurations;
* Simple usage.

# Also
You can help our project!

Most all kinds of contribution are welcomed. Feature requests, bug reports, test cases, benchmarks - all are welcomed.
